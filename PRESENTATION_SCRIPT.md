# Presentation Script

Good morning everyone.

## Name of My Project

The name of my project is **Call of Jesus** or **COJ**.

---

## What My Project Is

My project is a Christian worship website where people can find song lyrics and chords for worship songs. It works like a mobile app because I made it as a Progressive Web App.

---

## What My Project Does

This website helps people in many ways:

- Users can search for worship songs and read the lyrics
- They can see the chords for playing guitar or piano
- They can change the song key if it is too high or too low for their voice
- They can turn on auto-scroll so the lyrics move automatically while singing
- They can adjust the font size for better readability
- They can watch YouTube videos of the songs
- The website works in both English and Hindi
- Users can install it on their phone like a real app
- It works even without internet after the first visit

There is also an admin panel where the church can add new songs, manage events, and send notifications to users.

## How I Made It

I used modern web technologies to build this project:

- **Next.js 16** - This is a framework that makes websites very fast
- **React 19** - This is a library for building the user interface
- **TypeScript** - This is like JavaScript but it catches errors while coding
- **Tailwind CSS** - This helped me style the website quickly
- **Supabase** - This is my database where I store all the songs and user data
- **GSAP** - This library helped me add smooth animations
- **Three.js** - This helped me add 3D effects to make the website look modern

I deployed the website on **Vercel** so anyone can access it from anywhere.

## What Features I Added

I added many useful features:

1. **Song Transposition** - Users can change the key of any song with one click
2. **Search Function** - Users can search songs even if they make spelling mistakes
3. **Auto-Scroll** - The lyrics scroll automatically while singing with adjustable speed
4. **Font Size Control** - Users can increase or decrease text size for better reading
5. **Offline Mode** - The website works without internet using Service Worker
6. **Push Notifications** - The admin can send updates to all users
7. **Admin Panel** - A complete system to manage songs, artists, and events
8. **Responsive Design** - It looks good on phone, tablet, and computer
9. **Dark Mode** - The website has a beautiful dark theme

## What I Learned

While making this project, I learned many things:

- I learned how to use Next.js and its App Router
- I learned how TypeScript helps prevent bugs in code
- I learned how to make a website work offline using Service Workers
- I learned how to connect a database and fetch data
- I learned how to send push notifications from a website
- I learned how to deploy a website to production
- I learned how to make a website responsive for all devices
- I learned how to work with 3D graphics in the browser

The most challenging part was implementing the song transposition feature and making sure the offline mode works properly.

## Why It Is Useful

This project is useful because:

- Church members can easily find worship songs with chords
- They do not need to buy songbooks or search on different websites
- They can practice songs at home by changing the key to match their voice
- The admin can update content without knowing how to code
- It works offline so people can use it even in areas with poor internet
- It saves time during worship practice and services

This project can be used by any church or worship team around the world.
